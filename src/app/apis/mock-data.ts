    desc: 'Ronaldo had made his first appearance for Portugal’s full national team against Kazakhstan in August 2003. He was a key player in Portugal’s fourth-place finish at the 2006 World Cup and became the full-time captain of the national team in 2008. In 2012 his stellar play led Portugal to the semifinals of the European Championship, where his team was eliminated by rival Spain in a match that was decided by a penalty kick shoot-out. Ronaldo came into the 2014 World Cup hot off of his second world player of the year win, but his play at the tournament was spotty, and the entire Portugal team struggled during a group-stage elimination. In 2016 he helped Portugal win the European Championship, the country’s first major international tournament title, although he only played sparingly in the final because of a knee injury that he had sustained early in the match. Ronaldo played brilliantly at the 2018 World Cup, scoring four goals in four games as Portugal advanced to the knockout. In the Euro 2020 portugal were drawn into Group F called the Group of Death with teams like France, Germany, Hungary and Protugal.Euro 2020 start was great for Ronaldo with scoring in every Group Stage Game against all 3 opponents and breaking the Euro all time Goal scoring record.'
